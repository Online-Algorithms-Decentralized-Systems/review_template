\section{First Pass}
In this section, fill out each of the following questions (from~\cite{how_to_read_a_paper}) to provide a high-level overview of the paper.
This section does not need to be in prose format.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Category: What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A description of a research prototype?
    \item Context: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem? Which experimental methods were used to evaluate the results?
    \item Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid? Are the theorems correct? Is the experimental methodology correct?
    \item Contributions: What are the paper's main contributions?
    \item Clarity: Is the paper well written?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Second Pass}
In this section, provide a concise summary of the paper, capturing its main contributions, methodology, and findings. The summary (written in prose) should address the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Objective:} What problem or question is the paper addressing, and why is it significant?
    \item \textbf{Approach:} What methods or frameworks does the paper employ to address its objective?
    \item \textbf{Results:} What are the key findings or outcomes of the research?
    \item \textbf{Implications:} How do the results contribute to the field, and what are their potential applications or future directions?
\end{itemize}

This section should be comprehensive enough to provide a clear understanding of the paper's core content without requiring the reader to refer back to the original text.

\section{Third Pass}
In this section, provide a detailed evaluation of the paper, focusing on its strengths and weaknesses. Consider the following aspects:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Strengths:} What aspects of the paper are particularly well-presented? This may include the novelty of its contributions, the rigor of its methodology, or the clarity of its presentation.
    \item \textbf{Weaknesses:} What are the limitations or shortcomings of the paper? Consider gaps in the research, weaknesses in the argumentation, or issues with reproducibility.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, this section should discuss \textit{new} related works that have been published after the subject paperâ€™s release. Explore how these newer works build upon, challenge, or expand the original paper's findings. 

Use proper citations formatted with BibTeX (referencing `refs.bib') to incorporate these additional sources, like this~\cite{how_to_read_a_paper}.
